description: 'Migrating my Wordpress blog to Gatsby.'

I recently decided that's time to shut down my old wordpress blog. I've created it back in 2012 or 2013, because I wanted a blog but I didn't have the time to create something myself, I just wanted something that worked to write on, I wished Medium existed back then, but it didn't, so I started writing about learning Drupal... in a Wordpress blog. Controversial, I know.

So far I just created a Gatsby blog with the [gatsby-starter-blog](https://github.com/gatsbyjs/gatsby-starter-blog). And I'll be playing with it and extending it.

I've also followed [taniarascia's](https://www.taniarascia.com/migrating-from-wordpress-to-gatsby/) blog about how to migrate a Wordpress blog to Gatsby.
