You can add the ability to store and display date information in your Drupal 7 website with the use of the Date and Calendar modules, which in turn depend on the Views and CTools modules. Here is one quick demonstration of how you can enable and configure these modules in order to let your users post information that contains dates.

To make the best use of this screencast it would be awesome to have some prior exposure to the Views module for Drupal. You should also have working knowledge of Drupal including the installation of contributed modules.
