The WordPress.com stats helper monkeys prepared a 2014 annual report for this blog.

[![](//s0.wp.com/wp-content/mu-plugins/annual-reports/img/2014-emailteaser.png)](http://cristinallamas.wordpress.com/2014/annual-report/)

Here's an excerpt:


<blockquote>The concert hall at the Sydney Opera House holds 2,700 people. This blog was viewed about **9,700** times in 2014. If it were a concert at Sydney Opera House, it would take about 4 sold-out performances for that many people to see it.</blockquote>
