This screencast demonstrates the recipe for Imagecache and Imagefield (for CCK) to build a system for posting images on your Drupal website. This is a robust and flexible system for handling images and has a bright future with more helper modules born every day.

This micro-lesson depends on prior understanding of the CCK module and the Views module. This example uses Drupal 5 since the Image\* modules for Drupal 6 are not available (yet).
