This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Introduction

This is a personal project to get to know some aspects of React and GraphQL.

Continuous deployment with [Netlify](http://www.netlify.com) at [cristinallamas.netlify.com](http://cristinallamas.netlify.com).

## Components

Following Brad Frost's Atomic design approach, the components will be divided into:

- Atoms are UI elements that can’t be broken down any further and serve as the elemental building blocks of an interface.
- Molecules are collections of atoms that form relatively simple UI components.
- Organisms are relatively complex components that form discrete sections of an interface.
- Templates place components within a layout and demonstrate the design’s underlying content structure.
- Pages apply real content to templates and articulate variations to demonstrate the final UI and test the resilience of the design system.
